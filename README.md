# âš¡Evergy Integration for Home Assistant - WORK IN PROGRESS
# Status: Work in progress, still in dev.

A simple utility that you can use to login to your Evergy account and retrieve you meter readings.

> **Note: This is an unofficial utility that uses Evergy's non-public API.**

> Previously known as "KCPL"

## Usage
sensor:
  - platform: evergy
    username: !secret evergy_username
    password: !secret evergy_password


### Output
The last element from the `get_usage()` will be the latest data. The `usage` is in kilowatt-hours. I believe the `peakDateTime` is the
time during that day when your usage was the highest and the `peakDemand` is how many kilowatts you were drawing at that time.

Latest data:

    'period': 'Saturday',

## Home Assistant Integration
There isn't currently an Home Assistant integration that uses this library. Checkout [this thread to see how others have used it in Home Assistant](https://github.com/lawrencefoley/evergy/issues/8#issuecomment-902181182).
If you want to use this in a HA integration, please do and I'll link it here!
