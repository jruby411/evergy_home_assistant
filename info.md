[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

A simple utility that you can use to login to your Evergy account and retrieve you meter readings.

> **Note: This is an unofficial utility that uses Evergy's non-public API.**

> Previously known as "KCPL"

## Usage

1. Copy the folder evergy into your Home Assistant custom_components folder
  <b>OR</b>
  Install via HACS (Home Assistatn Community Store) by adding this custom repository
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Within Home Assistant->Settings->Integrations->Add->Evergy


### Output
The sensor will present the latest data. The `Usage` is in kilowatt-hours. I believe the `Peak Date Time` is the
time during that day when your usage was the highest and the `Peak Demand` is how many kilowatts you were drawing at that time.
